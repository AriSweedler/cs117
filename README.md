# CS 117 final project

We will be making a networked version of Achtung die curve
Use this is a reference point(i.e. we may just rip this and add network capabilities to it)
https://github.com/stravid/achtung-die-kurve

This tutorial can also be helpful, for networking: https://codeburst.io/how-to-make-a-simple-multiplayer-online-car-game-with-javascript-89d47908f995 or creating the scene.

So elegant! The server is so ridiculously simply. We can host it on someone's machine for the demo easily, or I could put it on heroku like the other guy, I think I have some credits or something

After seeing that the car game used an outdated version of the phaser library, I searched for a phaser3 tutorial. I found something even simplet, also using the sockets.io npm module: https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-1/
